# AI Revolution – Demo Materials

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- Computers have evolved from pre-programmed systems using structured data (SQL) to real-time thinking machines.
- AI systems can understand language, images, voice, and learn dynamically without explicit coding.
- You can now teach computers your business using natural language and continuous interaction.
- AI is a full stack: Energy → Chips → Cloud → Models → Business Applications.
- Training happens in AI factories; inference happens in real-time business operations.
- This is the largest infrastructure buildout in history (energy, chips, models, data centers).
- AI will create jobs, not eliminate them—people who use AI will replace those who don't.
- Physical AI will unlock breakthroughs in chemistry, physics, medicine, and manufacturing.

## The AI Revolution: A 2-Minute Overview

We are living through the biggest computer revolution in history.

For decades, computers were pre-programmed machines that worked only with structured data and fixed logic. Today, AI systems can reason in real time, understand natural language, analyze images and voice, and learn dynamically. This is the first time we've had computers that are not pre-recorded.

Instead of writing code line by line, we can now teach computers our business just by interacting with them. You explain your problem, refine it through conversation, and the system becomes an expert in your domain. That's what people call prompts, vibe coding, or agents—but the real shift is that anyone can now program.

### The AI Technology Stack

AI is not just a model like ChatGPT. It's a full technology stack:

- **Energy**: Massive energy requirements at the foundation
- **Chips**: Specialized chips like GPUs and TPUs
- **Cloud & Networking**: Infrastructure to connect everything
- **AI Models**: Trained models that power the system
- **Business Applications**: Applications that run on top

### Training vs. Inference

There are two phases: **training** and **inference**.

- **Training** happens in AI factories where models are created and baked into chips.
- **Inference** is when your company interacts with those models in real time to run the business.

### The Global Infrastructure Buildout

We are in the middle of a multi-trillion-dollar global buildout—energy plants, chip factories, data centers, AI factories. It will be the biggest infrastructure project humanity has ever done.

### AI and Employment

AI is not taking jobs away. It's creating jobs—across engineering, trades, data centers, healthcare, manufacturing, and finance. The real divide will be between people who use AI and people who don't.

### The Next Frontier: Physical AI

Finally, the next frontier is **Physical AI**—systems that understand chemistry, physics, proteins, and materials. This will unlock breakthroughs in medicine, energy, and science beyond anything humans could do alone.

## The Winning Strategy

The winning strategy is simple:

**Use AI to do your job. Don't fight it.**

This is not the end of work. It's the beginning of a new kind of work.
