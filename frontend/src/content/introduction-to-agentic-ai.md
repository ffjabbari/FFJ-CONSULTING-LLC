# Introduction to Agentic AI

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to specific prompts, agentic AI can plan, execute, and adapt its behavior.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy**: Can operate independently
- **Goal-oriented**: Works towards specific objectives
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts behavior based on context
- **Tool-using**: Can interact with external systems and APIs

## How It Differs from Traditional AI

Traditional AI systems are reactive - they respond to inputs. Agentic AI is proactive - it can initiate actions and pursue goals.

## Use Cases

- Automated research and analysis
- Customer service agents
- Code generation and development
- Data processing workflows
- Content creation pipelines
