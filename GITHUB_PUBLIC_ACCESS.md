# Making GitHub Repository Public

Your GitHub repository is currently private, which requires login to access. To make it publicly accessible:

## Option 1: Make Repository Public (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/ffjabbari/FFJ-CONSULTING-LLC
2. Click on **Settings** (top right of the repository page)
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section
4. Click **Change visibility**
5. Select **Make public**
6. Type the repository name to confirm
7. Click **I understand, change repository visibility**

**Note:** This makes all code publicly viewable. Make sure there are no sensitive credentials or private information in the repository.

## Option 2: Use GitHub Pages (Alternative)

If you want to keep the main repo private but share a public view:

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to **Pages** section
3. Under **Source**, select a branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Select `/docs` folder (or root)
5. Save - GitHub will create a public site at: `https://ffjabbari.github.io/FFJ-CONSULTING-LLC/`

## Option 3: Create Public Mirror

Create a separate public repository that mirrors your private one:

1. Create a new public repository
2. Push code to it (without sensitive data)
3. Update the link in your website to point to the public repo

## Current Repository URL

- **Repository:** https://github.com/ffjabbari/FFJ-CONSULTING-LLC
- **Status:** Currently private (requires login)

## After Making Public

Once the repository is public, the GitHub links on your website will work without requiring login.
