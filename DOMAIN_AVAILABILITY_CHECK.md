# Domain Availability Check

## Quick Check Options

### Option 1: Run the Script (Recommended)
I've created a script for you to run locally:

```bash
cd /Users/fjabbari/REPO_CURSOR/FFJ-CONSULTING-LLC
./check-domain-availability.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Check via AWS Console
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home
2. Click "Registered domains" → "Register domain"
3. Search for each domain name
4. AWS will show availability and pricing

### Option 3: Quick Web Check
Visit these sites and search for each domain:
- https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/
- https://domains.google/
- https://www.godaddy.com/

## Domains to Check

1. **ffjconsulting.com** ⭐ (Top choice - short, professional)
2. **ffj-consulting.com** (Alternative with hyphen)
3. **ffjconsultingllc.com** (Includes LLC)
4. **ffjconsulting.cloud** (Modern, tech-focused)
5. **ffjconsulting.ai** (AI-focused, may be more expensive)

## Expected Pricing

- `.com`, `.org`, `.net`: ~$10-15/year
- `.cloud`: ~$20-40/year
- `.ai`: ~$50-100/year (premium)

## After Checking

Once you know which domains are available, let me know your preference and type **"DO IT"** when ready!

I'll then:
1. Register the domain (via Route 53 or guide you)
2. Set up Route 53 hosted zone
3. Configure SSL certificate
4. Set up CloudFront with HTTPS
5. Update all website code
6. Configure DNS
7. Test everything

**Ready to check?** Run the script or check manually, then let me know which domain you want!
